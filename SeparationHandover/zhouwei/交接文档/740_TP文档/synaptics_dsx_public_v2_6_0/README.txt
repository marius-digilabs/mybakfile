DRIVER PORTING
--------------

The procedures listed below describe the general process involved in porting the
driver to a target platform. Depending on the actual kernel BSP used for the
target platform, adjustments in the procedures and additional customization may
be needed.

1) Copy the synaptics_dsx folder in the kernel\driver\input\touchscreen
   directory of the driver tarball to the equivalent directory in the kernel
   source tree of the target platform.

2) Copy synaptics_dsx.h in the kernel\include\linux\input directory of the
   driver tarball to the equivalent directory in the kernel source tree of the
   target platform.

3) Add the line below inside Makefile in the drivers\input\touchscreen
   directory in the kernel source tree of the target platform.
         obj-$(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX) += synaptics_dsx/

4) Add the line below inside Kconfig in the drivers\input\touchscreen directory
   in the kernel source tree of the target platform.
         source "drivers/input/touchscreen/synaptics_dsx/Kconfig"

5) Update the defconfig file in the kernel source tree of the target platform by
   referring to the defconfig files in the driver tarball as examples.
   * The following configuration options need to be enabled in the defconfig
     file.
         ONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_CORE
   * One of the following configuration options needs to be enabled in the
     defconfig file based on the communication protocol of the touch controller
     used on the target platform.
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_I2C
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_SPI
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_RMI_HID_I2C
   * The other configuration options can be enabled as needed. The ones below
     are recommended.
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_RMI_DEV
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_FW_UPDATE
         CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_TEST_REPORTING

6) If the kernel source tree of the target platform uses the Device Tree model
   for hardware description, update the Device Tree by referring to the dtsi
   files in the kernel\arch\arm\boot\dts directory of the driver tarball as
   examples. The changes made in the dtsi file for the DragonBoard platform to
   include support for Synaptics touch controllers can be found by diffing the
   files below.
         apq8074-dragonboard.dtsi
         apq8074-dragonboard_original.dtsi

7) If the kernel source tree of the target platform uses board files for
   hardware description, update the board file by referring to the board files
   in the kernel\arch\arm\mach-omap2 directory of the driver tarball as
   examples. The changes made in the board file for the PandaBoard platform to
   include support for Synaptics touch controllers can be found by diffing the
   files below.
         board-omap4panda.c
         board-omap4panda_original.c



FIRMWARE UPDATE DURING SYSTEM POWER-ON
--------------------------------------

If the DO_STARTUP_FW_UPDATE macro in the synaptics_dsx_fw_update.c firmware
update module is enabled, the driver uses the kernel's request_firmware()
feature to obtain a default firmware image to do firmware update during system
power-on if necessary. The default firmware image is expected to live in a file
named startup_fw_update.img.ihex in the firmware\synaptics directory in the
kernel source tree during the kernel build.

To convert the .img firmware image provided by Synaptics to the .ihex format,
use the command below.
   objcopy -I binary -O ihex <firmware_name>.img startup_fw_update.img.ihex

To inlcude the firmware image in the kernel build so that it can be used for
doing firmware update during system power-on, place the .ihex file obtained
using the command above in the firmware\synaptics directory in the kernel source
tree and make sure the line below is added inside Makefile in the firmware
directory in the kernel source tree. Note that the line below is commented out
by default in the example Makefile in the driver tarball.
   fw-shipped-$(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_FW_UPDATE) += synaptics/startup_fw_update.img



VIRTUAL BUTTONS
---------------

The example board file (board-omap4panda.c) and dtsi file (synaptics-dsx.dtsi)
contain support for virtual buttons. In the example board file, the virtual key
map is defined in the vir_button_codes data structure. In the example dtsi file,
the virtual key map is defined with the synaptics,vir-button-codes property.

Detailed information on the virtual key map can be found in the link below.
   http://source.android.com/devices/tech/input/touch-devices.html#virtual-key-map-files

In addition to the virtual key map file, a key layout file also needs to be
created and placed in the system\usr\keylayout directory in the Android file
system. The key layout file to match the virtual key map defined in the example
board file and dtsi file needs to be named synaptics_dsx.kl and contain the
following information.
   key 102 HOME VIRTUAL
   key 158 BACK VIRTUAL

Detailed information on the key layout file can be found in the link below.
   http://source.android.com/devices/tech/input/key-layout-files.html#virtual-soft-keys

When there are virtual buttons, the maximum sensor Y coordinate may extend
beyond the area covered by the display. In this case, the maximum Y value for
the display (i.e. 2D touch) area is specified with the DSX_MAX_Y_FOR_2D macro in
the example board file and with the synaptics,max-y-for-2d property in the
example dtsi file. Note that this maximum Y value for the display area needs to
be specified in sensor resolution units, not in display resolution units (unless
the two match).



MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
---------------------

Wakeup Gestures
** To enable wakeup gesture support, set the WAKEUP_GESTURE macro defined in
   synaptics_dsx_core.c to true.

Microbootloader Mode I2C Slave Address
** TDDI solutions implement an on-chip microbootloder due to the use of an
   external flash where the bootloader, UI firmware, and various configuration
   areas reside. The microbootloader may have a unique I2C slave address and is
   used during recovery when the external flash is blank or corrupt. The unique
   I2C slave address of the microbootloader may be defined with the
   DSX_UB_I2C_ADDR macro in the board file or with the synaptics,ub-i2c-addr
   property in the dtsi file.
